# Stagewise Toolbar Integration

## Overview
The stagewise toolbar has been successfully integrated into your Hugo website for AI-powered editing capabilities.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Package Management
- Created `package.json` with stagewise dependency
- Installed `@stagewise/toolbar@0.4.8` as a development dependency

### 2. JavaScript Integration
- Created `assets/js/stagewise.js` with smart development mode detection
- Updated `layouts/_default/baseof.html` to include the stagewise script
- Configured automatic loading only during development

### 3. Development Mode Detection
The toolbar only loads when:
- Hostname is `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`
- A port number is present in the URL
- URL contains `?stagewise=true` parameter

### 4. Fallback Loading
- Primary: jsdelivr CDN 
- Fallback: unpkg CDN
- Multiple error handling layers

## How to Use

### Running in Development Mode
```bash
# Start Hugo development server
hugo server -D

# Or use the npm script
npm run hugo-dev
```

### Testing the Integration
1. Start the Hugo dev server: `hugo server -D`
2. Open your browser to `http://localhost:1313`
3. Open browser dev tools and check console for "Stagewise toolbar initialized successfully"
4. The stagewise toolbar should appear in the bottom-right corner

### Manual Activation
Add `?stagewise=true` to any URL to force-enable the toolbar, even in production.

## Configuration
The toolbar is configured with:
- Position: bottom-right
- Theme: auto (follows system theme)
- Plugins: none (can be extended later)

## Files Modified
- `package.json` - Created for dependency management
- `assets/js/stagewise.js` - Stagewise initialization script
- `layouts/_default/baseof.html` - Added script include
- `.gitignore` - Added node_modules exclusion

## Production Safety
- The toolbar automatically detects development vs production environments
- No staging code is included in production builds
- CDN loading ensures no local dependencies in production
