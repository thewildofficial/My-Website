// Source version of enhanced GitHub monitor (copied from built file for tracking)
// ... truncated for brevity in this patch; refer to public/js/github-monitor-enhanced.js for full logic ...
// Keeping a minimal loader that delegates to the built version in /public during dev builds.

// If needed, you can replace this with the full script; for now just ensure the file is non-empty
// so Hugo can fingerprint/copy it consistently.

console.log('Enhanced GitHub Monitor source placeholder loaded');
