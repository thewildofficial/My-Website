## **Being a hacker sounds really cool.**
But how do you become one?

In this resource guide, i will try to tackle this question by identifying a few essential *skills and websites* that helped (and is continuing to help) me learn how to hack.

# 1. googling
This is one of the most underrated and valuable skills to have as someone who works with computers. Being able to *find information* and *research* will certainly get you further in the cybersphere.

# 2. Linux
Anyone who aspires to become a hacker **must** have at least a passable knowledge of Linux. Although you could work with operating systems like Windows or macOS, it is ill-advised because *most tools and framework* are made for Linux in specific.

Popular hacking (more commonly called as “pentesting”) frameworks like Kali Linux or Parrot OS have a lot of tools built-in, which is very convenient

# 3. Capture the flag 
Now we are starting to enter the more interesting stuff!

Capture the flag (CTFs) are mini-games that are hosted on a platform to enable hackers to practice their skills in a safe environment.
Most CTFs have a system wherein you have to enumerate a system and find a certain file or so-called “flag”

one of my favorite CTF is the [over the wire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/), and it really helped me to start off

# 4.TryHackMe boxes
[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) is an excellent website to start understanding tools and frameworks. 
They have amazing rooms like the metasploit and nmap walkthroughs that really help you grasp how a tool or a framework works.

You can also go down one of their [learning paths](https://tryhackme.com/paths), which will have your understanding a concept at a deeper level.
# Where Next?
Assuming you have done all the above, you can say with certainty that you have **mastered the basics of hacking.** 



:confetti_ball: congrats!
Your next step might be researching about fun domains like **Bug bounties** or **freelance pentesting.**

else, you may also want to do rooms (similar to TryHackMe) on [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.eu/)
