## Motivation has a shelf life.

It changes like the weather.
Although it is a seasonal phenomenon, it still carries a great deal of power.

In this blog post, I aim to explain how you can motivate yourself to do hard habits, even though you may feel low.

## Step One: Genuinely be interested in whatever you want to pursue.

You cannot be internally motivated to do anything when you do not like doing it. If you pursue a skill or task that you generally like (or have a strong incentive to do), you are more likely to have the motivation to become very good at it.

If you are not sure on whether you actually like the task, It is a good idea to introspect and really think about it.*(noting down your thoughts in a journal or diary is super useful!)*

## Step Two: Unlock the power of consistency.

It is a common fallacy that to do difficult tasks, you need to take drastic measures. The greatest achievements come out of small actions done *consistently*.
If you have the dream of becoming a great magician, you don't have to do a show every day. This will actually **drain** your motivation since it is very intensive.

Instead, all you have to do is do a single trick a day, and when all those days compound, and you will find yourself at the top.

## Step Three: Fall and get up again.

In any journey, there will inevitably be rainy days. You may make mistakes while developing a habit, and that is absolutely okay.
Failure is an integral part of growth. What matters is that you continue doing it, even if you feel like giving up. **Even doing 1% every day is enough to keep you going.**
To give an example, today I feel particularly lethargic. However, I want to become a good blogger, so I wrote down the draft of this post even if I didn't feel like it. I know that once I finish this post I will feel a sense of accomplishment and that's what keep's me going.

##  Step Four: Introspect.

You may reach a point where you feel you have plateaued, or not progressing anymore. At this point, it is crucial that you analyze your techniques related to the habit. A few questions I like to ask myself when I plateau are:
- what have you been doing good?
- Where could you possibly improve?
- What new things (related to the habit) are you interested in learning/doing.


## Bonus Step: Get an accountability partner
 
 I found it useful to have someone else who learns a skill alongside me. Be it a friend, family member or even some random people on discord. You could also share what you have learned with your partner, which helps in finding new ideas/concepts(Learn — Do — Teach paradigm). Accountability partners are a sure-fire way to up the stakes to keep yourself motivated to continue doing/learning a task.
