## Cold Showers are becoming cool again.
From the lifestyles of US Marines, to the legendary Wim Hof (AKA the Iceman), cold showers have become synonymous with the Healthy Grind set.
Many reports, backed by plenty of [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5025014/) have found pretty eye-opening benefits from this seemingly trivial ritual. Some benefits often talked about are:
- Increased testosterone/alertness
- Stronger Immunity
- Faster Recovery after exercising
- Better Skin Quality
- Helps in burning fat

## Sounds good… But why?
I think that the idea of cold showers is more of a mindset thing. In the current day and age, most of us take things for granted and become very *comfortable* with our lives. This is a problem because the moment we bask in the luxuries of modern living, we **stop growing**.

Cold showers, to me, is a metaphorical journey to *seek discomfort* (one of my favorite catch lines, well done yes theory).

Even if it may not theoretically offer any benefits, it's the way of the Stoic… Actively trying to feel uncomfortable in order to grow as a person.

## Methodology to taking cold Showers
There are three common ways of talking cold Showers
1) transitioning from hot-to-cold 
2) edging into the cold 
3) jumping straight into the cold stream
 It may be extremely uncomfortable for about 5 seconds, but the feeling passes soon after.
 ## My experience
  At the time of writing this blog, i have personally taken cold showers every morning for a week. It feels absolutely brilliant with higher levels of motivation and alertness. This, along with [Wim Hof's breathing technique,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tybOi4hjZFQ) has given me days of more happiness, energy and confidence.
  
 Step out of your comfort zone, and you shall do wonders.
