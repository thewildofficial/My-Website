## Times have changed.
Today, the man who can adapt the fastest and handle the most information is the man who wins.

This shift in focus of the economy from physical labor to *intellectual* labor has created an industry around learning, in contrast to education.

This industry is what I like to call, the **absorb and learn** niche, which serves information through media like:
- watchable courses (YouTube, udemy, skillshare and the plethora of other course providers)
- pamphlets and books 
- certifications

All these options, makes it more difficult to choose a medium and stick with it. Personally,i find myself searching on sites rather than actually doing some deliberate practice.

Let's take programming, for example. When you start learning a new programming language, would you rather watch 4 hours worth of course material by a top university, or spend the same 4 hours messing about on your own.

The answer is complicated.





### Okay... so, what is the real answer?
There is this neat idea floating around the internet called the *Pareto principle*.
> **80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes**

We have so much material today online, and i have personally found that only a fraction (around 20%) of it actually helped me learn a new skill.
Therefore, it would be very useful to have a sort of model in which you moderate the amount of content you consume, and increase how much content you produce/ act upon.

You don't become a great boxer by only reading 300 books about thrusts. You *do* become at least a good enough boxer if you participate in 300 matches where you apply the ideas of a select few books and material.

This works the same way with exam material. A lot of my peers scramble to buy new and trendy workbooks to prepare for upcoming competitive exams. However, previous results show that the toppers of these exams themselves only used some very high quality, reputed textbooks and did not care to distract themselves by the tide waves of new information.


Therefore, a factional advice would be to *Learn 20% of the time, work 80% of the remaining time*. Try to do a bit of research about a new skill you are learning, but in the remaining time truly work on it with principles like spaced reputation, and deliberate practice.

> Passive learning creates knowledge. Active practice creates skill.
