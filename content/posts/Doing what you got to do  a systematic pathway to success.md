### There is something extremely important that I have learned over the last few months.
If one has gotten into their self-improvement journey, they will eventually realize one thing: you would have to **do the hard work, ESPECIALLY when you don't feel like it**.
There is great power in getting something hard or boring to become a routine habit just by doing it repeatedly. Imagine going to the gym in the morning without a single word of protest every day. Or… studying for 6 hours with no feelings of resentment.

Such can be done by fighting something called ** Limbic Friction**

#### Uh… What is “limbic friction”?
Limbic friction could be described as a sort of mental barrier, lack of motivation or focus. The great neuroscientist [Dr. Andrew Huberman. PHD ](https://hubermanlab.com) coined this term to describe what exactly goes through your mind when you decide to watch one more YouTube video instead of going and studying trigonometry.


Now… How is it that we can overcome this? How do awesome personalities like [David Goggins](https://davidgoggins.com), who most people think of as the epitome of grit and discipline, do the hard work when they don't feel like it?

To quote [tinkered thinking](https://www.tinkeredthinking.com/index.php?id=978):
>The interesting thing about friction in the real world is that the more that friction is engaged over time, the less that friction becomes… Stone steps wear smooth after enough treading feet.  An old piece of clothing becomes soft from use.  River stones grow smooth and round.


**WE GET MORE DISCIPLINED AT SOMETHING BY DOING THAT THING AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN.**

We must understand that motivation and discipline come OUT of your work, and is not actually required to do the work itself

You get more motivated by finding yourself doing the 100 pull up, not just thinking about starting.

For example, Today, i really didn't feel like writing this blog post. I have plenty of reasons in my head such that I have my finals in a couple of days, that I am such a shit writer, that no one would care to read my work… But I fought through it
I fought the mental battle, allotted some time to get this all written down.


So yeah, if you want to get disciplined, prepare yourself to fight, and conquer your mental battles. My tips would be to improve your mental health, and (I know this quote is getting repetitive, but it's extremely important to internalize)

**DO THE HARD WORK, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE IT**
