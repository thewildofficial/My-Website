## This is a legendary book, its reputation proceeds it.
All the productivity greats like [Thomas Frank](https://www.youtube.com/user/electrickeye91) and [Ali Abdaal]( https://www.youtube.com/c/aliabdaal/videos) have recommended it…so this month I have decided to check it out.

And boy, does it deliver.

## Core ideas
First, I think we should define what an “Atomic Habit” really is.
Many of us think that to be successful, we should do great feats…but in fact, that is **not** true at all!
The Greatest achievements come from the smallest changes that are done *consistently*.

The Idea that stuck out to me the most was growing everyday by just **one percent.** It may not be that noticeable at first, but it is indeed meaningful in the long run.

If you improve by a single % every day for a whole year…you would be 365 (or 366!) percent better than you were at the start of the year!

Growth is not linear, it is compounded, which I genuinely find a good thing!

Even though you will find minimum results for your effort when you start, later on the curve you will find yourself gaining more out of less effort, which is truly amazing!

### Systems over Goals
> the purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game.

In habit building, there is no rigid end point.it is a continuous process of self-development and refining until you are the best you can be.
Therefore, looking for longevity rather than instant gratification in habit building proves more successful in the long run.
### Habits shape your identity
Why do you want to become fit? Why do you want to become better at drawing/cooking/playing a sport?
Identity matters when it comes to habit building. In case you want to start a new habit (such as eating healthier because you are becoming overweight), you should lean in to making the habit as a part of who you are, as it will make it more likely that it sticks.

- Whenever you write a blog post, you become a blogger
- every time you exercise, you become a healthier person.

Its constant self affirmation that brings you to whom you want to be.


- Habits are behaviors that when repeated, they become subconscious and automatic
- the purpose of habits is to solve problems with as little effort as possible
- the 4 steps of habits are cues, cravings, response, reward
	- To give an example, today I made my first [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9QE3Snono8)
	- cue: making a to-do and constant reminders from my dad 
	- craving: actually starting my YouTube channel, linking it to my blog
	- response: learning to edit the best i can that future videos become easier
	- reward: I'm going to order some food today :D (shawarma or pizza, haven't decided yet)
 
 ### The 4 laws of behavior change
 1) make it obvious
	 - if I want to read a book, I should keep the books close to me
2) make it attractive
	- getting books that interest you to develop a habit of reading
3) make it easily
	- I don't like brushing manually, so an electric tooth brush helps me brush more regularly
4) make it satisfying
	- seeing that you are progressing as a person over time and logging it

### Now for the most powerful Idea,
habit stacking.
In the pasts, I used to follow were rigid schedules/to-do lists.
Sure, I used to use them and all was fine for a few days but with life, changes always happen, and it gets difficult to stick to things after a while

Habit stacks are, less rigid, frameworks of how you want to go about your day. It is vague enough to allow distractions, but still asserts that you grow 1% in that day.

You put habits that you want to do in between a habit that you do regularly (waking up to taking a shower) and a habit that you enjoy (playing video games or playing with your dog)


The end of the book has a powerful line that I think sums up everything well,
> tiny changes, remarkable results. That's the power of Atomic Habits.


You can find the book [here](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299) and I recommend everyone to at least give it a shot and watch your habits compound.


Happy reading!
