AI has certainly been a term that has been blowing up in the last few months.Tools like ChatGPT and the image generators like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion has taken the world by storms (funnily enough, pretty as I predicted)

In the year 2020, when all of us were stuck indoors all day, I was bored out of my mind and ran into OpenAI's novel text generation project, GPT-3.

Immediately I saw the potential.
In fact, a business idea popped into my head.

GPT-3 at that point could actually write pretty convincing essays and idea explaination (the example case, if i remember correctly, was *describe quantum physics to a 5 year old*).
I wanted to create a tool students could use to quickly answer factual/language based questions, which in retrospect was a ChatGPT-eque clone (image linked below)
