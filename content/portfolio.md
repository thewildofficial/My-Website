I have been writing code ever since I was 12.From that point, I have been absolutely engrossed with computers and the cyberspace. Here are some of the projects I've worked on: 
# Projects
- **[Project Skilltree](https://www.projectskilltree.com/)**:  A revolutionary discord bot/app used by over 5,000+ users which aims to gamify the journey of self improvement. I was instrumental in developing significant parts of the bot interface and API.

- **Clevered.com Internship**: Successfully completed a 4-month long internship on Artificial Intelligence(AI), mentored by a senior Oxford professor.I developed a project that involved a website which predicts and forcasts sentiment and emotional response of any tweet using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

- **[Nexus Aurora](https://nexusaurora.org/)**: Former project lead at Nexus Aurora, An open-source space colonization community (Winners of the [2020 Mars Society City State Competition](https://www.marssociety.org/news/2020/10/23/top-5-winners-of-mars-city-state-design-competition-announced/)). My work involved designing door security systems, using RFIDs. Also, I facilitated and collaborated in committees involving sports and linguistics in Mars. I also played the lead role in developing the discord bot for the server.

- **[Perspective AI](https://www.amazon.com/Perspective-Artificial-Intelligence-Aban-Hasan/dp/1678985988)**: I co-authored this book along with a schoolmate during my grade 8. It is meant to be a teenager's perspective on the advent of artificial intelligence, and how we predict AI will impact our lives and the future.

- **[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/thewildofficial) and CTFs**: I have always had a deep interest in cybersecurity, and this obsession has led me to being ranked in the top 2% of hackers on tryhackme.com, a website which organizes hacking challenges.

# Extracurriculars and Initiatives

- National level contestant of the French Word Power examination, Organized by the Quebec Government Office in Mumbai. I speak french to a moderate level of proficiency, estimated to be around B1.


- 3 time Model United Nations (MUN) winner. My deep interest in leadership and geopolitics lead me to frequently participate in Model United Nations conferences.This has developed my professional and collaborative network, and has immensly benefited in my public speaking and criticial thinking skills.


- Read over 150 books in the last two years on books ranging anywhere from Self-Development, Finance, Health and Philosophy. This has given me wider perspective and broadened my mind to alternative possibilities.


- Frequent volunteer in school events, I find purpose in constructively engaging with my wider student-community.It has taught me to stick to my promises and shown me the value of contributing to greater causes.


- School Valedictorian in grade 10, and Student Council member in grade 11 and 12. I learnt how to resolve conflicts, and find amicable solutions that leads to a win-win.


- Founder of an unofficial "Self-Improvement Club" in my college. I took this initiative to find a sense of brotherhood, and it has lead to a culture of constant growth within my friend-circle. This further has helped me become accountable and disciplined.
	> "The More I Teach, the More I Learn!" 


- Other hobbies include Weightlifting, Chess, Tennis, Taekwondo and Horse-back riding.

# Extracurriculars and Initiatives

I am a firm believer that every person must be the leader of their own mind.I have an affinity for leadership roles because I have a deep desire to see meaningful improvements in myself, in people around me and society as a whole:



* This is precisely why I ran for Student council in grade 12. Through being a council member, I organised school events, contributed to associations/clubs, and served as a collaborator between students and staff. 
* I have attended plenty of Model United Nations contests and public speaking workshops, where I have learnt the importance of interpersonal skills.
* My desire for finding a circle of individuals on self-improvement led me to join the online community of a popular youtuber known as [Hamza](https://www.youtube.com/c/Hamza97/videos). In this community I have actively participated and have given lectures on topics like Social Skills, Debating and Reading. For my contributions, I have been recognized and nominated as the moderator of the discord server.
* In this community, I found a persisting pain point of people in general, who perceived that although they are working to improve themselves, it was challenging to track their habits and monitor their progress. This lead me to collaborate with members of the community in creating [project skill tree](https://www.projectskilltree.com/).
* Skill Tree is a discord bot interface (and future app) aimed to "gamify" and chart one’s self improvement journey. It is currently used by over 5000 unique users, and charts habits like Journalling, Meditation and Weightlifting. I worked extensively on the front-end and API of this Interface. Working on this project taught me a lot about teamwork, User Experience, Deadlines and Marketing.
* OpenAI GPT-3 Official Beta tester, I was among the first to use GPT-3 Technology, with special approval from the OpenAI CEO.
* My earliest venture was when I, as a 14 year old during class 8 where along with my two other classmates found a company, where we organised discussions and participated in our cities tech competitions. I learnt a lot about business stratagies and a taste of what it means to be a CEO/Founder.
