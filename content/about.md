# :wave: Hello, I'm Aban
I'm 17 and currently live in India, but i consider myself a citizen of the world.
An ambition i commit myself to is to make the world a better place through innovation and mastery.
I believe it is my duty to guide myself and others around me into becoming more competent and self-aware human beings.


## Projects
- [Skill Tree](https://projectskilltree.com/): A mobile app and discord bot which aims to gamify self-improvement. I was involved in developing the [discord bot](), which is currently used by over 2800 users. 

## Interests
In my free time, i play chess, read, lift heavy weights.
I am facinated by ideas in philosophy,religion and the sciences.
If there are two things i love the most about this world, it are *people* and *machines*.

Computers are miraculous devices and i've found myself drawn to sub-fields like Cyber-security, Artificial Intelligence and Machine-Human interfaces
