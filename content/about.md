## Who I Am

I'm someone who thinks deeply about technology's role in shaping human potential. Not in the shallow "tech will save us" way, but in wrestling with the real questions: *Are we building tools that extend human agency, or are we creating digital cages that hollow us out?*

Currently, I'm building forward from two angles: studying Data Science & Applications at IIT Madras while diving deep into practical engineering at Scalar School of Technology. This isn't about collecting credentials—it's about understanding both the theoretical foundations and the pragmatic realities of building systems that matter.

I dropped out of Carleton University after my first year. Not because I couldn't handle it, but because I realized I was optimizing for the wrong variables. Sometimes the most autonomous choice is to step off the predetermined path.

## What Drives Me

I'm fascinated by the intersection of **agency and technology**. How do we build systems that amplify human potential rather than extract from it? How do we create tools that serve genuine human flourishing instead of feeding what I call the "attention economy hydra"?

<div class="interest-card">
<h3>🧠 Intellectual Pursuits</h3>
<p>Philosophy, geopolitics, consciousness studies. I spend considerable time thinking about autonomy vs. heteronomy—the difference between self-directed action and following someone else's playbook.</p>
</div>

<div class="interest-card">
<h3>⚡ Technical Focus</h3>
<p>AI/ML, cybersecurity, human-computer interfaces. I'm particularly interested in open-source alternatives to Big Tech's closed-source surveillance capitalism.</p>
</div>

<div class="interest-card">
<h3>🏋️ Physical Practice</h3>
<p>Lifting, chess, reading. I believe in cultivating both mental and physical strength. The discipline required for physical training translates directly to intellectual rigor.</p>
</div>

<div class="interest-card">
<h3>🎯 Applied Skills</h3>
<p>Sales, persuasion, human psychology. Understanding how people think and decide is crucial for building anything that actually matters in the real world.</p>

## My Perspective

I see myself as part of a generation that has **skin in the game** with the AI revolution. We're the ones who will live with the consequences of the choices being made today by people like Musk, Altman, and Zuckerberg.

This isn't about naive tech optimism. I'm deeply skeptical of the current trajectory where a handful of technocrats build closed-source systems that increasingly govern our lives. We need more people thinking seriously about alignment—not just AI alignment, but alignment between technology and genuine human flourishing.

<div class="agency-section">
<h3>On Agency</h3>
<p>Most people vastly underestimate their capacity for autonomous action. They mistake intelligence for agency, when in reality <strong>agency trumps intelligence</strong> in almost every meaningful context. Steve Jobs wasn't necessarily the smartest person in Silicon Valley, but his reality distortion field—his sheer willpower to bend the world to his vision—changed everything.</p>

<p>The question isn't whether you're smart enough. The question is whether you're willing to take responsibility for shaping your reality instead of letting external forces shape it for you.</p>

## What I'm Building

This website serves as both documentation and reflection. I write about ideas that matter: the war against heteronomy, cyberslavery, the attention economy, human agency in an algorithmic age.

I'm not trying to build a personal brand or optimize for engagement metrics. I'm trying to think clearly about complex problems and share those thoughts with people who care about similar questions.

The projects I work on center around one core question: *How do we build technology that genuinely serves human potential?*

## Connect

I'm always interested in conversations with people who think seriously about these problems.
