<h1 align="center"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="32"> Hi, I'm Aban!</h1>

I'm 17 and currently living in India, and in my final term of Grade 12.

I see myself as an ambitious and perispicacious individual and have always been fascinated by computers and human relationships. I believe that business and technology skills are a powerful combination and hence really seek to equip myself with the best of both worlds.

I commit myself to make the world a better place through technology, personal development and innovation.

I believe it is my duty to guide myself and others around me into becoming more competent and self-aware human beings.

This website is dedicated to documenting my projects and serves as a hub for my online presence.

## Interests 


In my spare time, I read, play chess, and lift heavy weights. 

I am also facinated by ideas in geopolitics, philosophy, spirituality and the sciences. 

If there are two things I love the most about this world, it is people and machines.

Computers are miraculous devices. I’ve found myself drawn to sub-fields like Cyber-security, Artificial Intelligence and Machine-Human interfaces.
