<p>Irrelevant question.
Why? Because all of us need, and deserve, a meaningful social connection, regardless of how we feel like in social situations.
We deserve to not feel awkward around other people, because inevitably we will have to deal with them.
The complex social structure of our society is what truly makes us human.
I have noticed many in the self-improvement community trying to act like this <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sigma%20male">lone wolf, sigma male character</a>, thinking that would help you excel in your work and ambitions.</p>
<p>Most don&rsquo;t realize how truly life changing some beautiful friendships can be. There are people who will be with you through your darkest days, celebrate your wins and never abandon you however fucked up mistakes you may make.</p>
<p>My aim is to meet these kinds of people, and recently I have been thinking really deeply about how do i prime myself to meeting and working with these brothers.</p>
<p>Here are a few base steps/protocols that have helped me find homies with similar interests</p>
<h1 id="step-1-priming">STEP 1: Priming<a href="#step-1-priming" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h1>
<p>We all have to start from somewhere… And if you are anything like me, you were/are a bit awkward.
Social Skills, as obvious as it sounds, is a <strong>skill</strong>, a skill that requires deliberate practice and the discomfort that comes with meeting new people.</p>
<p>There is this notion that you may get smirked at, or have some people think you are weird. However, i assure you that this is not usually the case. Sure, some people may, but you must realize that those are not the people you want to/deserve to surround yourself with. Remember, in this journey we are trying to surround yourself with the top 1%, the best, the most intelligent, the most hardworking people.</p>
<p>Also, it is worth noting that every social encounter you have is some valuable experience. Every new person you meet is <em>one rep for your social-skills muscle</em>. Embrace bad social encounters, since they make you stronger.</p>
<p>Here is a good protocol that seems to work for most people: Talk to one new person every day, with no exceptions.
I have found the most success with this in High School (i&rsquo;m a junior). Academic Institutions are incredible venues for making new friends. If you are in uni or in HS, i encourage you to walk around during recess, talking to new people for practice.</p>
<p>You may say that you are into remote work, or just don&rsquo;t have the opportunity to meet many people.</p>
<p>Take a walk then, meet the old men in the park, talk to the girl walking her dog in the park, compliment the jacked guy who is doing pull-ups on the monkey bars.</p>
<p>Most people love to be approached and complimented. There is not enough friendliness and kindness in today&rsquo;s world. Be the one who makes another human&rsquo;s day a little better.</p>
<p>A RESOURCE: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034">How To Win Friends and Influence people</a> is basically the bible of social skills, read it and re-read it until you are ready for the next step</p>
<h1 id="step-2-adding-value">Step 2: Adding Value<a href="#step-2-adding-value" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h1>
<p>By now, you have talked to a lot of people (lets say, 50.). You have had multiple nice encounters, maybe a few deep conversations, and are generally getting more comfortable around people.</p>
<p>In essence, you have been spending your time <em>approaching</em> new people.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s learn to get people to like you more.</p>
<p>And there is one, and truly one way to do this.
you have to <strong>add value to people</strong>. This can happen in a lot of ways. A common form of value you have with your current friends/normal friendships would be shared experiences. You and your best friend in school had to sit through years of excruciating math classes together, and that really gave you two the opportunity to get to know each other and bolster a friendship.</p>
<p>You can also add value by having <em>specific knowledge</em>, or skills like charisma/being funny and engaging.</p>
<p>Truly ask yourself, “How can I make this girl day 1% better today?”, could you teach something new and profound? Can you say a joke they will think about for days? Can you truly impress her?</p>
<p>Remember, <strong>if you focus on what other people want, you will be popular for the rest of your life.</strong> If this does not make sense to you… go back to step one 👆🏼, you clearly aren&rsquo;t ready yet.</p>
<p>Who are the type people in your ideal friend group? What kind of value they expect? How will you cater those needs? These are questions you must answer!</p>
<p><strong>Social skills are a skill</strong>. It is NOT meant to be something you would have out of nowhere. Even the most charismatic people got to that point because of practicing social interactions. So get up from your $399 PewDiePie gaming chair, wipe the Doritos off your shirt, and go out into the world brah.</p>
<h1 id="step-3-expansion">Step 3: Expansion<a href="#step-3-expansion" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h1>
<p>Now, you have friends, you have value.
But wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to have more of both 😃 ?
This is the way to go up and beyond, truly cement yourself within the top 1%.
We live in an age of <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/877321503896854528?lang=en">Infinite Leverage</a>, With the internet giving people from even the most remote societies in the world access to a global community, and giving groundbreaking knowledge and perspectives. This step will really get you noticed, and social fulfillment you would have never felt before.</p>
<p>Here is what you must do: Start a YouTube channel, blog or podcast. These are the main ways i have found people can spread wisdom online. Microblogging and social media like Instagram and TikTok are okay for this, but you cannot reach the depth required to spread your passion.</p>
<p>One of my reasons for starting this blog was to find like-minded people, to meet friends for life, I know that if I can freely express my ideas online, U will eventually and inevitably meet at-least one person who I am at the same frequency with. Even though this blog only has about 10 readers (for now, love you Gs), my consistency and effort shall surely win me some friends in the long term.</p>
<h1 id="step-4-consolidation">Step 4: Consolidation<a href="#step-4-consolidation" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h1>
<p>Congrats! You found them! You found the homies :), you found the people who would be with you in your wins, and at your loses. You found the people who wouldn&rsquo;t want anything from you except your own growth. Now what?
You are the top. You are hanging out with Adonis, Maximus and Ares. These type of people are invested into growth, and don&rsquo;t drink, smoke, jack off or indulge in instant gratification. Organize events and meetups semi-regularly so that you maintain the bond you worked so hard on, and continue growing.</p>
<p>PS: i have ripped off parts of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSKxhR-YDMI">Hamza&rsquo;s video</a> on the topic, so go check it out if you have read so far, he really goes deep into this shit and hits your feels</p>
<p>good luck,soldier</p>
