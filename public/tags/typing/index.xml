      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;typing-has-become-and-exceedingly-useful-skill-over-the-last-few-years&#34;&gt;Typing has become and exceedingly useful skill over the last few years.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My journey started with a single link. A friend wanted to compare our typing speeds. At the time, i was pretty slow, having to look down at my keyboard every time I wanted to type a single character (I cringe at the thought, in retrospect).&#xA;At the time, everyone were much faster than me, I was at a slow 25 WPM and didn&amp;rsquo;t care much about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
