&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;The most emaciated, low-vitality cultures that racists berate eat the most grain.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is an ugly observation. The kind of statement that hangs in the air, thick with the weight of unsavory history. The typical response is to recoil, to dismiss it as a crude stereotype and nothing more. But what if, instead of dismissing it, we dared to dissect it? What if we could flip this ugly statement from a tool of racial prejudice into a fruitful scientific question?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Silicon &amp; Six-Shooters: AI as Manifest Destiny</title><link>https://www.abanhasan.net/posts/cowboys/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.abanhasan.net/posts/cowboys/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>To be in software in 2025 is to be a cowboy in 1900. You&amp;rsquo;re living on the precipice of a bygone era, one that you barely comprehend is gone, as the industrial giants and their Pinkerton armies push you further west, towards an unknown horizon.

&lt;p>All we seek is clarity. Yet, it appears that everything around us – everything we see, everything we touch – is designed to be noisy, to disrupt every thought we have before it can fully form. Entire teams of researchers, scientists, psychologists devote their lives to finding and &amp;ldquo;pulling the right&amp;rdquo; switch in our minds, optimizing for engagement, for distraction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our inherent capital – the finite time and vibrant youth we possess – is systematically siphoned off to feed the mainframe, the ever-hungry digital systems that thrive on our attention.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The War Against Heteronomy</title><link>https://www.abanhasan.net/posts/thewaragainstheteronomy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 08:38:35 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://www.abanhasan.net/posts/thewaragainstheteronomy/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>Recently, I came across a thread on X by the brilliant Andrej Karpathy, which made me reflect deeply on the nature of action and its relation to both individual fulfillment and collective progress.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
