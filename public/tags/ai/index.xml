      <description>&lt;p&gt;What makes the modern manifestation of cloud capital, integral to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://thebeautifultruth.org/the-basics/what-is-technofeudalism/&#34;&gt;Technofeudalism&lt;/a&gt; system we live under, is that it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to go anywhere without having it glaring at you. It hovers above the heads of modern people like a cloud, taking all our attention and carefully curating it, effectively extracting life energy and transmuting it into data and narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nick Land extensively talks about hyperstition, and the memesis we see via social media enables false narratives to take on a life of their own, often manufactured by the techno-oligarchs themselves in service of their political ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-hunger-for-clarity&#34;&gt;The Hunger for Clarity&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All we seek is clarity. Yet, it appears that everything around us – everything we see, everything we touch – is designed to be noisy, to disrupt every thought we have before it can fully form. Entire teams of researchers, scientists, psychologists devote their lives to finding and &amp;ldquo;pulling the right&amp;rdquo; switch in our minds, optimizing for engagement, for distraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our inherent capital – the finite time and vibrant youth we possess – is systematically siphoned off to feed the mainframe, the ever-hungry digital systems that thrive on our attention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
