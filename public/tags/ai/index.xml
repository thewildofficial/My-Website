      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To be in software in 2025 is to be a cowboy in 1900. You&amp;rsquo;re living on the precipice of a bygone era, one that you barely comprehend is gone, as the industrial giants and their Pinkerton armies push you further west, towards an unknown horizon. The open range is closing, fences are going up, and the rules are changing. This isn&amp;rsquo;t just a shift; it&amp;rsquo;s a reckoning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:60191/images/cowboy_city.png&#34; alt=&#34;A lone cowboy gazing at a futuristic city skyline&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All we seek is clarity. Yet, it appears that everything around us – everything we see, everything we touch – is designed to be noisy, to disrupt every thought we have before it can fully form. Entire teams of researchers, scientists, psychologists devote their lives to finding and &amp;ldquo;pulling the right&amp;rdquo; switch in our minds, optimizing for engagement, for distraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our inherent capital – the finite time and vibrant youth we possess – is systematically siphoned off to feed the mainframe, the ever-hungry digital systems that thrive on our attention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What makes the modern manifestation of cloud capital, integral to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://thebeautifultruth.org/the-basics/what-is-technofeudalism/&#34;&gt;Technofeudalism&lt;/a&gt; system we live under, is that it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to go anywhere without having it glaring at you. It hovers above the heads of modern people like a cloud, taking all our attention and carefully curating it, effectively extracting life energy and transmuting it into data and narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nick Land extensively talks about hyperstition, and the memesis we see via social media enables false narratives to take on a life of their own, often manufactured by the techno-oligarchs themselves in service of their political ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
